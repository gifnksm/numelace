# Backlog

Casual backlog for ideas, experiments, and future work. Order is not strict.

## Ideas / Wishlist

- Candidate marks in the UI
- Undo/redo
- Hints and mistake detection
- Save/load game state
- Timer and statistics
- Solver technique extensions (pairs, pointing, box/line, X-Wing)

## Bugs / Fixes

- None listed yet

## Notes

- It’s OK to list “maybe” ideas here, even if you’re not sure you’ll build them.
- Keep items short and lightweight.
- Move decisions and rationale to DESIGN_LOG.
